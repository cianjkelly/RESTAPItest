# RESTAPItest

Please find the API main files attached.

The API will not be able to run as it was built using the connection and database based on my localserver.

However I have attached screenshots of the postman commands for GET, PUT and POST.

Also pfa the unit test for POST in the test section on the file. 


The Controller class feeds into the Service class which then leads to the serviceImpl class.

From the serviceImp calls the Dao class and this then uses the SQLQueries to execute the SQL commands.

Serveral problems were encoutered during the course of this challenge and we can discuss during the interview.

I would also like to make many changes to the code if given more time, however again this can be discussed during the course of the call.
